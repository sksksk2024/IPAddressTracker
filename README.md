## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### What I learned

Including `Vite`, `Vitest`, and `TypeScript` was my biggest achievement this week—and also the most challenging part. I found it fascinating to work with two APIs for the first time. That’s about it!

### Continued development

I will explore the technologies I've used in greater depth, as well as learn about the power of `web-vitals` and incorporate it into my next project.
